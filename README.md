# Spreadsheets automate üöÄ

In this project, I decided to have some fun by delving into the functionalities of the openpyxl and pyautogui libraries. Through this exploration, I gained valuable insights into the realm of automation and spreadsheet manipulation using Python. Leveraging the openpyxl library, I learned to seamlessly interact with Excel files, accessing cells, modifying data, and orchestrating various operations with ease. Additionally, integrating pyautogui into the workflow provided an exciting avenue to automate user interface interactions, enabling me to simulate keyboard and mouse actions to navigate through Excel applications. This hands-on experience not only broadened my understanding of Python's capabilities but also equipped me with practical skills to streamline repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. Overall, this project was an enriching journey that solidified my proficiency in Python and empowered me to explore further possibilities in automation and data manipulation.
